# descartes_data_scientist_test

Hello ! 

The csv output is the file "prediction.csv" on the root folder.
The notebook is the jupyter file "notebook_oussama_emtl.ipynb"

I enjoyed this test but I am still wondering how Shell_auto and Mean_auto files were supposed to be used since their index was the same as the test sample. I hope we could discuss it in the interview.
